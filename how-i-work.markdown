I enjoy reading the "How I work" articles that I see on personal blogs. In my opinion they are really useful to capture how a person operates. Of course this is by no means for anyone to adjust to my style nor I'm enforcing everything written below. It is also evolving and I keep updating this reference based on learnings and change of my preferences.


### Working with Marek
I usually work 9:00am to 4:30pm GMT and then often 9:00pm to 10:30pm GMT. The time between, including weekends, I aim to reserve for my family and personal projects.

Family is wife and two young kids (age 5 and 3). I try to avoid frequent overnight stays and travel if possible. If you need someone to regularly spend 2-3 nights in a week at a customer site, I won't be the right fit for such gig at the moment.

If you get an IM or email from me at odd times, you do not need to respond to it that moment. Do it at your own time.

I am a fan of written, asynchronous communication to get things done and to:
- avoid people feeling left out if not able to join a meeting
- protect focused work
- clearly articulate and refine ideas

Outcomes vs activity.

I do my best to have and protect focus time.

Self-development is important. I book regular times to learn, and encourage others to do the same.

I learn from my mentors as well as from mentoring others. Investing in others' success and seeing them grow and succeed is one of the most rewarding thing I experienced in my career.

I highly value feedback, and welcome it. Thank you in advance!

I work mostly remotely but I believe in value of meeting in-person. It's important for me to meet with people we work with.
