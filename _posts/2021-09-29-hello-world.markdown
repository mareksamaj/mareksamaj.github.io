So here I am, 15 years after my last blog post. If anyone remembers "thespoke.net", circa 2004-2006 and the Microsoft fandom community that evolved around [Imagine Cup][imagine-cup], please give me a shout. I was there too, with my sporadic blog, but more importantly with great bunch of people and community that inspired me in the early years of my career.

Lots happened since then, I turned my hobby ("computers") into a job, married an amazing girl and started  family. And as I always enjoyed writing, here is restart of yet another sporadic blog.

I write about tech, Microsoft, DevOps and life in general. Odd stuff may appear about my other hobbies such as Flying from time to time.

As you can see, this site needs "some" work, hence in addition to writing I will be spending some time on it too.

Be kind and take care. I shall write soon. :-)
