I often get questions from folks new in the business how to plan a technical career in company such as Microsoft in medium-long term, e.g. what jobs to go after, in which area, when...

The advice I give is simple - the role you really want probably doesn't exist in the company today. Focus on what you like working on & with who, what you don't like and figure out what you are good at. Then try to understand where people like you thrive in the company. The Like/Don't likes should be specific enough to be used as qualification criteria to pick up the right work, guide your learning, consider new roles & career opportunities etc. It's important to stay focused. 

Consider if climbing the imaginative corporate ladder will deliver a fulfilling career for you. These days there are many ladders within a single company and new ones are appearing all the time. Hence it is important to focus on you, i.e. what makes you happy, where you learn most and where you have the biggest impact.

And when you get there, remember that your actual job title doesn't really matter. Don't make the job title your career goal. Senior, Director, VP... doesn't mean anything if not put into the context of what you actually do. You don't need a "cool" job title to make an amazing impact.
