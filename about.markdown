I'm a Solutions Architect, Private Pilot and a techno-optimist. I believe in technology and its ability to drive positive change in society, if it is used right and responsibly.

### More About Me 
I fell in for tech as a young child thanks to PC games such as Prince of Persia, Dune 2 and later the Might and Magic D&D saga. This was then reinforced by Star Trek and my appreciation of engineering characters and the space technology there.

Fast forward, here I am, working for Microsoft as a Solutions Architect in consulting / professional services division. I joined Microsoft 18 years ago from University and I'm still there, learning and having lots of fun.

I have this blog to write for the sake of writing. Writing helps me decompress and organise thoughts better. I also want to keep sharp on basic dev skills which I don't use that often these days. The blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] and it is built in [Jekyll][jekyll]. I write posts in VSCode, with the help of the [Code Spell Checker][code-spell-checker]. Blog repo is [here][gh-repo].

If something isn't working, please let me know [Issues][gh-repo-issues].

This is a personal blog, its content and opinions are my own.
