I'm an [IT Architect][iasa-it-architect], [Private Pilot][caa-private-pilot] and a techno-optimist. I believe in technology and its ability to drive positive change in society, IF it is used right and responsibly.

Ask me about:
- I'm in the Cloud, now what?
- Use technology with purpose.
- Empower people to embrace change.

### More About Me 
I fell in for tech as a young child thanks to PC games such as Prince of Persia, Dune 2 and later the Might and Magic D&D saga. This was then reinforced by Star Trek and my appreciation of engineering characters and the space technology there.

Fast forward, here I am, working for Microsoft as a Solutions Architect in consulting / professional services. I joined Microsoft straight from University and I'm still here, more than a decade later.

I have this blog to write about stuff for the sake of writing about stuff. For a strange reason writing helps me decompress and organise thoughts better and who knows, maybe someone finds my ramblings useful hence posting it all here. I also want to keep sharp on basic web dev skills which I don't use that often these days. The blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] and it is built in [Jekyll][jekyll]. I write posts in VSCode, with the help of the [Code Spell Checker][code-spell-checker] and [VIM Emulation][vim-extension]. Blog repo is [here][gh-repo].

If something isn't working, please let me know [Issues][gh-repo-issues].

This is a personal blog, its content and opinions are my own.
