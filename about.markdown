I'm an [IT Architect][iasa-it-architect], [Private Pilot][caa-private-pilot] and a techno-optimist. I believe in technology and its ability to drive positive change in society, IF it is used right and responsibly. "Good servant, but a bad master" applies here as anywhere else.

I fell in for tech as a young child thanks to PC games such as Prince of Persia, Dune 2 and later the Might and Magic D&D saga. This was then reinforced by Star Trek and my appreciation of engineering characters and the space technology there.

Fast forward, here I am, working for Microsoft as a Solutions Architect in consulting / professional services. I joined Microsoft straight from Uni and I'm still here, more than a decade later.

I have this blog to write about stuff for the sake of writing about stuff. For a strange reason writing helps me decompress and organise thoughts better and who knows, maybe someone finds my ramblings useful hence putting them here. I also want to keep sharp with basic web dev skills which I don't use that often anymore. The blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] and it is built in [Jekyll][jekyll]. I write posts in VSCode, use the [VIM extension][vim-extension] and push to the [GitHub repo][gh-repo].

If something isn't working here, please let me know [Issues][gh-repo-issues].

This is a personal blog, its content and opinions are my own.
